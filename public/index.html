    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <h2>My name is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_(name)" class="emph">Tyler Boyd</a></h2>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer from Kansas City. I have been breaking and fixing computers for my whole life, and have been developing professionally for almost 5 years now.<br/><br/>Almost all of my professional experience is with Full Stack Web Development, using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Go. I have gained experience in several front end frameworks, including SvelteKit, Vue, and React. I have also had the great joy and honor of working with several different databases and backend languages, my favorite being the Postgres and Go combination.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am constantly learning new technologies, frameworks, languages, and tools. It is my favorite part about this field, that there is always something new to learn, and something to get better at. I am trying to contribute more and more to the open source communities, as a way to learn and master new technologies.
